    "## [1.1] How to \"store\" a function in computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often we don't have a mathematical formulation for the function. We only have limited information about the function such as function values at several given points.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a function $f(x)$ defined on $[-1, 1]$ and we know its values at $x=-1$, $0$ and $1$. Then we store in computer $f(-1)$, $f(0)$ and $f(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course if we know the function values at more points, we can store more in computer. BUT! There are infinitely many points on $[-1, 1]$ (and in fact uncountablly many) and there is no way to store all of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a theorem that might help us:\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------\n",
    "## Weierstrass Approximation Theorem: \n",
    "If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and if $\\epsilon>0$, then there is a polynomial $p$ satisfying $|f(x)-p(x)| \\le \\epsilon$ on the interval $[a, b]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, one way of thinking is to \"represent\" a continuous function by a finite degree polynomial, and we only store in computer the coefficients of the polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have $f(-1) = 4$, $f(0)=2$ and $f(1)=2$. Then the polynomial that passes through these points is $p(x)=2 - x + x^2$. So we store in computer three values, $2$, $-1$ and $1$. If we want to evalute the function at a point $x_0$ we just evaluate $p(x_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds good?! In principle if we have $n+1$ points of a function, we can construct a $n$th-degree polynomial that passes through these $n+1$ data points. We then \"expect, hope, pray\" that this new polynomial is a good representation of the function, i.e., $f(x) \\approx p(x)$ for all $x$.\n",

    "#### Remark 1: \n",
    "There is a HUGE difference between storing the \"discrete data points\" and \"discrete coefficients\" of a function. The former one is a discrete description and we only have information on the given points, while the later one is actually a continuous description and we can get the value of every single point on the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remark 2: \n",
    "One can imagine that there is a vector space consists of all the polynomials. A natural basis for this space is $\\{1, x, x^2, x^3, ...\\}$. So every polynomial, under this basis, have a coordinate. For example, the coordinate of $f(x) = (x-1)(x-2)$ is $[2, -3, 1, 0, \\cdots]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remark 3: \n",
    "For periodic functions on $[0, 2\\pi]$, the natural basis functions are $\\{1, \\sin(x), \\cos(x), \\sin(2x), \\cos(2x), \\sin(3x), \\cos(3x), ...\\}$. A function being present in this basis is called \"Fourier series\":\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = a_0 + \\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1} a_n\\cos(nx) + \\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1} b_n\\sin(nx).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The constants $a_0, a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, ...$ are called Fourier coefficients."
